//! Contains V2 of the slate (grin-wallet 1.1.0)
//! Changes from V1:
//! * ParticipantData struct fields serialized as hex strings instead of arrays:
//!    * public_blind_excess
//!    * public_nonce
//!    * part_sig
//!    * message_sig
//! * Transaction fields serialized as hex strings instead of arrays:
//!    * offset
//! * Input field serialized as hex strings instead of arrays:
//!    commit
//! * Output fields serialized as hex strings instead of arrays:
//!    commit
//!    proof
//! * TxKernel fields serialized as hex strings instead of arrays:
//!    commit
//!    signature
//! * version field removed
//! * VersionCompatInfo struct created with fields and added to beginning of struct
//!    version: u16
//!    orig_verion: u16,
//!    block_header_version: u16
